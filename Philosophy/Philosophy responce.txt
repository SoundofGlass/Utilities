10/10 Philosophy Responce


I would always go for killing the singluar rather then the multiple if I were forced to choose
between pulling the lever. 
There are more chances that 5 people could do good then one, but this also doesn't include the
people themselves. Who they are, what kind of life do they lead or how are they treated in this existance?
I could be killing a greatly loved and famous person that's tied down but if they lead that kind of life, 
would they hate me for killing them? Or would they also agree to sacrifice themself as well to save the others.
It's a debate that could go on for ever and ever, with many different logics and outcomes.
But if you were just solely going to chose, 1 or 5, I go for 1.
